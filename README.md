## Mechanical-Rubiks-Cube-Solver
The MRCS is a physical machine that uses 6 stepper motors, 6 TB6600 H-bridges, 3d printed parts (using Fusion 360 and Cura), and an Arduino UNO to solve the cube.
The user will enter the mixed state of the cube into the cube solving Java program I made, and the code analyses and outputs a series of turns that will solve the cube. Arduino IDE code is used to drive the
motors and execute the turns for the cube given by the Java program. Short video of the physcial machine:
